Configure WIFI which connects automatically to home network:
File : /etc/network/interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet manual

auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
address 192.168.0.14
netmask 255.255.255.0
broadcast 192.168.0.255
gateway 192.168.0.1
wpa-ssid "D-Link_DIR-600M"
wpa-psk "PgFriends@123"

Deamon:
RFSFniffer Binary
Run Program RFSNIFFER binary on RPI2 which waits for input from arduino door open , then it captures 10 sec video and sends push notification and again waits for input .It is in while loop.


temp Binary
Which monitors RPI2 Soc temp , when it crosses 60 deg it sends push notification to android app installed mobile and when it crosses 0 deg , It will poweroff RPI2. Heat sinks are provided to release temp.

//Make RFSniffer and Temp Binary as deamon and run these process in background.
The changes made to Raspian are follows
1.create execute.sh file and chmod 777 execute.sh and place it inside /etc/init.d/.
//execute.sh
#!/bin/sh
/home/rf_rx/433Utils/RPi_utils/RFSniffer &
/home/rf_rx/433Utils/RPi_utils/temp &

2.Update rc to defaults
sudo update-rc.d execute.sh defaults 

3.To remove
sudo update-rc.d -f execute.sh remove



Now RFSniffer and temp process runs at background . That is you just have to power on the RPI2. When debugging is required ssh to 192.168.0.14 2222 port number
