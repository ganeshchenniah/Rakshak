# Rakshak
Rakshak-The House Guard
This is a home security project .
I have added readme files inside other folder which helps you understand better . Please go through all readme files
Project UseCase :
When you are going out of the house or when security is needed you need to enable Rakshak by plugging into a power source.
fter locking the door, Rakshak starts guarding your house. When an intruder tries to open the door the alarm triggers  
and immediately camera captures intruder's video footage and pushes app notification to your mobile and at the same time 
it triggers high intensity buzzer which bulldozes the intruder.

Concepts Used:
Radio Transmitter and Reciever 434 MHz.
Port Forwarding of Multiple Ports (I am Using ACT Connection) which allows my mobile network to allow into the reciever.
Understanding of kernel and Device driver Conecpts of LINUX.
Android Application.
